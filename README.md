# Doctoral Registration Management

This is the Full stack app for managing the registration of doctoral students. The app is built using the following technologies:
- Spring Boot for the backend
- Angular for the frontend
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Docker for containerization
- pgAdmin for database management
## Pre-requisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
## Project structure

- Dockerfile: The file used to build the Docker image for the backend.
- docker-compose.yml: The file used to run the backend and the database and connect them together with the frontend.
- ./frontend/Dockerfile: The file used to build the Docker image for the frontend.


## Services

- **db**: PostgreSQL database
- **springapp**: Spring Boot application
- **pgadmin**: pgAdmin for database management
- **frontend**: Angular frontend application

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Back_End-Spring-Boot
cd Full-project
```
## Build the Docker images
    
```sh
    docker-compose build
```

## Run the Docker containers
    
```sh
    docker-compose up
```
This command will build and start all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Accessing the Services

- Spring Boot Application: http://localhost:8080
- Angular Frontend: http://localhost:4200
- pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050

## Stopping the Docker containers

To stop the running containers, use the following command:

```sh
docker-compose down
```
## Database Configuration
The PostgreSQL database is configured with the following default settings:
- Database Name: JEE
- Username: postgres
- Password: root
You can change these settings in the docker-compose.yml file if needed.

## pgAdmin Configuration
The pgAdmin service is configured with the following default settings:
- Email: admin@admin.com
- Password: admin

You can access pgAdmin at http://localhost:5050 and use these credentials to log in.
You can also change these settings in the docker-compose.yml file if needed.

## Frontend Configuration
The Angular frontend application is configured to connect to the Spring Boot backend at http://localhost:8080. You can change this setting in the environment.ts file in the frontend source code if needed.

## Backend Configuration
The Spring Boot application is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database at http://db:5432. You can change this setting in the application.properties file in the backend source code if needed.
